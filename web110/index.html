       <h2 class="subheader">About me....</h2>
       
       <p>I moved to Seattle, WA on April 24, 2019 from Texas with my partner. For the past 4 years or so, I have worked in the Insurance industry as a Claims Representative/Adjuster in Texas.  I figured it was going to be an easy transition for me in Seattle and I would have no problem finding a job in the Insurance industry; however, that was not the case.  I did not want to just take any job when I worked so hard in Texas to get where I was, especially income wise.  And, so this began to weigh on me.  So, one evening, my parter and I talked and thought perhaps this is the best time for a career change and think about what I would like to do for the second half of my life.  </p>
           
       <p>I wanted to study something that I was going to enjoy doing, that was the most important.  Secondly, I wanted to study something that was in high demand in the employment world.  So, I enrolled into Seattle Central College in the Fall Quarter of 2019 and decided to study Web Development.  Now, I have NEVER programmed or coded in my life!  So, this is very intimidating for me because my knowledge of computers is that of an average every day user.  I know how to start and shut off a computer, do google searches, and check my emails.  That's it!  My plan is to finish up the certificate program and then go after the Associate's program.  After that, I hope to find work with a major corporation in the Seattle or Greater Seattle area as an entry-level or Jr. Web Developer.</p>

       <h3>A little more about me....</h3>

       <p>In my spare time, I enjoy reading Young Adult Fiction (don't judge me!).  I am currently reading "The Truth as Told by Mason Buttle" by Leslie Connor.  I enjoy going to the movies.  The last movie I saw was "Bad Boys for Life" with Will Smith and Martin Lawrence.  My parter and I also enjoy taking our 8 month old lab puppy - Sunday - to dog parks.  My favorite is Luther Burbank Park in Mercer Island.</p>
